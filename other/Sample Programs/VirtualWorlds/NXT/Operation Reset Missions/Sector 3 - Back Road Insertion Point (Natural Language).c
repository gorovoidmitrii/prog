Sector 3 - Back Road Insertion Point (Natural Language)
- This program will cause the robot to drive forward from Sector 1 into Sector 3, and turn toward
	the Charge Cube in that area.
- It will be up to you to add the ROBOTC code that causes the robot to pick up the Charge Cube
	and take it to the Communication Tower pad.
- ROBOTC must be in Natural Language mode for this program to run. You can set this in the top menu
	by going to Robot > Platform Type > LEGO Mindstorms > Natural Language (NXT).
- Remember that you can press the "Reset" button in the lower-left corner of the Operation Reset
	window to return to the Insertion Point every time you modify your ROBOTC code.
*	Please note that the values in this program were written for Mammalbot using a high-end computer.
	You may need to adjust the values in this program for your computer.
